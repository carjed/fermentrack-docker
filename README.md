# Fermentrack Docker Image

If you want to know more about Fermentrack please go to https://docs.fermentrack.com/.

In the future the version tag will be used to track the base installation, linux version, nginx, redis python etc. There will most likley be a new build every 3-6 months to include new security fixes from the core components. But you can always fork the repository and do your own build if you want. 

```
Note! Older images are no longer compatible with Fermentrack releases after 5 April 2021. Use image v0.8 or higher
```
